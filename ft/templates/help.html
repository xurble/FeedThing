      <h2>Help</h2>

      <p>
        FeedThing is a personal, web-based feed reader with an emphasis on simplicity and
        preventing information overload.
      </p>

      <p>
        FeedThing can track the posts you have read in each feed and make sure you never
        miss a post, or it can act as a <a href="http://scripting.com/2014/06/02/whatIsARiverOfNewsAggregator.html">
        River of News</a> aggregor.  Or you can mix the two.
      </p>

      <h2>Reading Feeds</h2>
      <p>
        For tracked feeds, FeedThing does things a bit differently than most 3-pane agregators
        in an effort to make catching-up with feeds natural and low-friction.  Specifically:
        <ul>
          <li>There are only two panes - clicking on an unread feed loads all unread posts.</li>
          <li>Unread posts are presented in <i>chronological order</i> so you can catch-up by
          reading downwards like a human being.</li>
          <li>Reading a feed automatically marks all posts as read so there so it's low effort
          to declare unread-post bankruptcy and bring yourself up to date.
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>Adding Feeds</h2>
      <p>
        You can add feeds via the "<a href="{% url 'addfeed' %}">Add Feed</a>" menu item or with this bookmarklet.
      <p>
        Simply drag this button onto your bookmark bar:
        <a class="btn btn-default btn-sm" href="javascript:document.location.href='https://feedthing.net/addfeed/?feed=' + encodeURIComponent(document.location.href);">Subscribe in FeedThing</a>
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to import your subscription list from another service, you can do that in
        <a href="{% url 'addfeed' %}">Add Feed</a> page as well, if you have your feeds in <a href="http://opml.org/spec2.opml">OPML</a>
        format.
      </p>

      <h2>Organising Feeds</h2>
      <p>
        From the "<a href="{% url 'manage' %}">Manage Feeds</a>" menu item, you can
        see details about all your subscriptions.  Feeds can be put into Folders
        e.g. by topic and both Feeds and Folders can be set to display as a River.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is (deliberately) only one level of hierarchy.  No folders inside folders.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an example I have my FeedThing set up as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Two River Folders - Fast Feeds (containing the feeds so some very prolific bloggers
            that such as <a href="https://kottke.org">kottke.org</a> and
            <a href="https://waxy.org">waxy.org</a> that I will never keep up with) and
            News (containing, well, news).
          </li>
          <li>
            All my other feeds at the root level with the exception of one or two
            authors that write in multiple places.  They get a folder each to group
            them, but not in river mode.  I still read every post.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        By default feeds will get the clever-clever name that is published in their
        RSS. You can override this to remind you what an infrequently-updated feed
        actually is in the Manage Feeds page and also by clicking the settings button
        at the top of reading pane when you load a feed.
      </p>
